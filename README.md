# Wi-fi Sumo Bots


Repository for our IEEE Wi-fi sumo bots project.

__What are the Wi-fi Sumo Bots?__


The goal of this project is to develop a sumo bots battle arena that is controllable by users remotely through a livestream. The robots will be real physical robots taking part in a sumo battle on a remote arena. We strive to make this event fun for everyone and also to aid with fundraising through stream donations.

**Current teams**:
Team | Members | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overall Design | Everyone | This team is tasked to design the basic requirements to get started with the project. Some of the tasks are: designing the bot shape, arena, interactive gameplay functions, and gameplay mechanics. It is to give vision to the project and have the big picture set |
| Web Interfacing | Mayra C., Marky, Raul C., Jaime V. | Create the method of controlling robots from the web. Also in charge of making a website that has the stream embedded within it and other web-based development. |
| General Programming | Ethan B., Raul C., Juan D. | Program the mechanical behaviors of robots and any arena hazards including the arena. All movements that need to be carried out will be programmed by this team. |
| Autonomous Mode Programming | Raul C., Ethan B., Juan D., Aram F., Mayra C. | Program the automatic routine that is done to put bots and stage back into position which includes proper orientation of robot. Will need to find a way for robots to locate itself relative to its starting position. |
| Hardware Quality Assurance | Marky, Ethan B. | Wire and solder every component together and verify that the hardware is properly set up. No shorts, loose connections, proper motor polarity, etc. Also that everything is properly seated. Will also do wire management around stage and make sure nothing gets crimped or crushed. Also make circuit diagrams of everything that is hooked up for reference in case of component failure. |
| Art/UI Team | Mayra C., Jaime V., Marky | Will create logos and graphics needed for the website, robots and arena. Will also pick any background music. |
